                            <p>In 2008, I moved from Pennsylvania to accept a middle school teaching job in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The kids I taught were great, but a few months into the job, I knew it wasn't for me. Then I met this great guy and enrolled in IIN the following summer. A couple months into the program, I knew I had found my calling with health coaching AND I knew I had found the guy I would be with for the rest of my life. Mike and I were married in early 2010, and by the end of the year we had our son, Owen.</p>

                            <p>In 2011, I told Mike that he would make a great health coach. He works a full-time corporate job and travels a lot and when he's home, he spends most of his free time with Owen. He wasn't a health nut when I first met him. In fact, the first time he took me out, he brought me to Outback Steak House. I was a vegetarian! I remembered how intrigued he was, listening to all the modules I was working on during my IIN program and how fascinated he was with all the information I was learning about. It was all new to him. He did think about it, enrolled in the next class, and happily graduated from IIN in September 2012. We are a family of health coaches! Thank you IIN!! :)</p>
